First Project: Super Bowl

In this project, I look at Super Bowl Data, generating insights into game outcomes, viewership, and even halftime shows. I try to answer the following questions for this project.
1-	What are the most extreme game outcomes?
2-	How does the game affect television viewership?
3-	How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
4-	Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?

Dataset:
The dataset I use was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. It is made up of three CSV files, one with game data, one with TV data, and one with halftime musician data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
